### CPSC 120
* Lab 2

    Lab 2: Even though looking back at lab 2 right now seeing it so simple I feel like doing it before seemed difficult. Looking back at it now Iâ€™m proud of how much I improved. Regardless of my improvements I feel like this lab is one of the most crucial because it covers the basics like declaring and initializing variables as well as taking in input and printing it. 
* Lab 4

    Lab 4: This lab helped me create a base level understanding of function files and creating functions for the main functions. This lab is so important to improving throughout future labs. Specifically part-1 though part-2 was also important because it introduced if statements which we used a lot after learning it in that lab.
* Lab 12

    Lab 12 Part 2: Doing this lab was probably the most interesting to me. Rather than printing words and games or marlins or math problems we printed an image. Using Magick::Images we got to create a gif that displayed RGB colors. By coding different colors into the width and the lengths and height. This complex code integrates a lot of what we learned including vectors, inner and outer loops, static cast, sin, argument sizes and many more. As well as the new concepts of color theory and coding it.
